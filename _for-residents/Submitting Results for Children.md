If you are submitting results for a child who
* is required to take an Antigen Rapid Test (ART), and 
* has a Singapore-issued identification number (i.e. NRIC/FIN)

please click [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/61515cd8855f49001279b2ef) to open a submission form, and submit the result of their ART swab from there instead.

Your submission will be sent automatically to the relevant authorities.

In case you test positive on your ART, please visit [go.gov.sg/covid-travellers](https://go.gov.sg/covid-travellers) for more information.
