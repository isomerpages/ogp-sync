### **Keep your COVID-19 records in sync**
Sync is a government web portal initiated by the Ministry of Health and [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/), GovTech, for anyone to share and submit COVID-19 records with organisations remotely.

Using Sync is like making a financial transaction; instead of money, Sync allows individuals to choose who to share their COVID-19 health records with, and can remove their consent at any time. 

Presently, Sync shares COVID-19 ART and PCR swab tests results, and vaccination records.


#### **How is Sync useful to you?** 
* Share your verified health records (PCR swab results & COVID-19 vaccination status) with any organisation you work with
* Submit weekly ART self-swab test results easily and securely


#### **What's in it for healthcare clusters?** 
* Timely access to verified vaccination status and test results of a healthcare worker (HCW) easily.
* HCWs provide consent to share their health records easily with organisations 
* Daily reports containing vaccination and test records of all HCWs who have provided consent will be sent to authorised P2P providers 
* Enables monitoring of workplace safety and booster vaccination progress
