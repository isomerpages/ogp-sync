### **Keep your COVID-19 records in sync**
Sync is a web platform built by [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/) that enables consent-based sharing of COVID-19 test results and vaccination records. Developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Sync allows individuals to instantly share their COVID-19 records with employers and organisations, while retaining full control over deciding who they share this data with.

At present, Sync allows individuals to share their COVID-19 ART and PCR swab tests results, and vaccination records.

#### **How is Sync useful to individuals?** 
* Share your verified health records (supervised ART & PCR swab results, and COVID-19 vaccination status) with any organisation you work with
* Submit weekly ART self-swab results easily and securely
* Control who you share your COVID-19 records with, and change permissions at any time


#### **What's in it for organisations?** 
* Timely and easy access to verified COVID-19 vaccination status and test results from employees and visitors
* Daily reports containing vaccination and test records of all individuals who have provided consent to the organisation
* Facilitates easy compliance with ongoing workplace monitoring protocols
