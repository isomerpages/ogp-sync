### **Keep your COVID-19 records in sync**
Sync is a web platform developed by [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/) that enables consent-based sharing of COVID-19 test results and vaccination records. Developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Sync allows individuals to instantly share their COVID-19 records with employers and control access rights.

Presently, Sync shares COVID-19 ART and PCR swab tests results, and vaccination records.

#### **How is Sync useful to individuals?** 
* Share your verified health records (PCR swab results & COVID-19 vaccination status) with any organisation you work with
* Submit weekly ART self-swab results easily and securely
* Control who has access to your COVID-19 records (can withdraw consent at any time)


#### **What's in it for organisations?** 
* Timely and easy access to employees' verified COVID-19 vaccination status and test results.
* Daily reports containing vaccination and test records of all staff who have provided consent will be sent to authorised admin users. 
* Enables monitoring of workplace safety and booster vaccination progress
