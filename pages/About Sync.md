### **Keep your COVID-19 records in sync**


Sync is a government web portal for anyone to share and submit COVID-19 records (vaccination and test records) with organisations remotely. Think of it like doing a financial transaction. Instead of money, Sync allows individuals to choose who can receive their COVID-19 health records and requires the individualâ€™s consent, which can be revoked by the individual at any time. 

Presently, Sync shares COVID-19 ART and PCR swab tests results, and vaccination records.


#### **How is Sync useful to you?** 
* Share your verified health records (COVID-19 vaccination status & ART swab results) with any organisation you work with
* Submit weekly ART self-swab test results easily and securely


#### **Beyond COVID-19 records**
