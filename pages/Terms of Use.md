While this cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.


You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.

**SCOPE AND SHARING OF DATA**

Sync is a service that helps to share your Covid-19 Vaccination Status, ART and PCR Test Records with non-government entities of your choosing. When you use sync, you consent to your Covid-19 vaccination status and test records of up to 2 weeks prior to your date of using Sync to be shared with the non-government entities of your choice.

We may share necessary data with other Government agencies, so as to serve you in the most efficient and effective way unless such sharing is prohibited by law.

For your convenience, we may also display to you your vaccination status and test records of up to 2 weeks prior to your date of using Sync. This will speed up the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating previous submissions. Should the data be out-of-date, please supply us the latest data.

Sync will not share your personal data with non-government entities unless (a) consent is provided to us voluntarily by you directly to the collection and usage of your personal data, and (b) the use and sharing of your data will be limited to the specific use-case that is listed when you are prompted to share data with non-government entities via Sync, or (c) collection and use of personal data without consent is permitted or required by the PDPA or other laws. 

Non-Government entities shall seek your consent before collecting any additional personal data and before using your personal data for a purpose which has not been notified to you (except where permitted or authorised by law).

**WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT**

The consent that you provide for the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data will remain valid until such time it is being withdrawn by you. You may withdraw consent and request non-government entities to stop using and/or disclosing your personal data for any or all of the purposes listed above by toggling the data sharing option in the Sync interface. 


Upon receipt of your request to withdraw your consent, non-government agencies may require reasonable time for your request to be processed and for them to notify you of the consequences of them acceding to the same, including any legal consequences which may affect your rights and liabilities to them. In general, they shall seek to process your request within ten (10) business days of receiving it.


Whilst they respect your decision to withdraw your consent, please note that depending on the nature and scope of your request, they may not be in a position to continue providing their goods or services to you. Should you decide to cancel your withdrawal of consent, please inform them in the manner described in clause 8 above.


Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect their right to continue to collect, use and disclose personal data where such collection, use and disclosure without consent is permitted or required under applicable laws. 


**PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA**

To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks, Sync has introduced appropriate administrative, physical and technical measures such as up-to-date antivirus protection, encryption and the use of privacy filters to secure all storage and transmission of personal data by Sync, and disclosing personal data both internally and to non-government entities only when consent is given by you. 

You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, Sync strives to protect the security of your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security measures.


**ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA**

Non-Government entities rely on personal data provided by you (or your authorised representative, medical service provider,or government agencies). In order to ensure that your personal data is current, complete and accurate, please update them if there are changes to your personal data. 

**RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA**

Non-Government entities may retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws.


Non-Government Entities will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which the personal data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.


**DATA PROTECTION OFFICER**

You may contact the Data Protection Officer of the relevant non-government entities if you have any enquiries or feedback on their personal data protection policies and procedures, or if you wish to make any request. Please contact the relevant non-government entity directly for details of how to contact their Data Protection Officer.
