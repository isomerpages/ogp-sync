Employees will receive reports in your email daily between **8-9AM**. 

The email will contain 3 csv files :
* vaccination_status.csv
* art_results.csv
* pcr_results.csv

These CSV files will contain data of employees who have given consent to share their data with you. It will contain test results up to **2 weeks** prior to the employees giving consent. 

All three CSV files will be sent in a password-protected folder. The password will be provided during onboarding.

If employees have not given you consent, please direct them to [go.gov.sg/sync](https://sync.covid.gov.sg/) to log in and share their data with you.

**Note: Please share one company email address for the daily reports to be sent to**
