At this phase, employees will receive reports in your email daily between 8-9AM. 

The email will contain 3 csv files :
* vaccination_status.csv
* art_results.csv
* pcr_results.csv

These CSV files will contain data of the HCWs **who have given consent** to share their data to you. It will contain test results up till **2 weeks** prior to the HCW giving the consent. 

All three CSV files will be sent in a password-protected folder. The password will be provided during onboarding.

If a HCW has not given you consent, please direct them to [go.gov.sg/sync](https://sync.covid.gov.sg/) to log in and share their data with you.

*You should share one company email address for the daily reports to be sent to.*
