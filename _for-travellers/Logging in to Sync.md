### **Sync for travellers**
![](/images/Loggin%20into%20Sync.svg)

Welcome to Singapore! 

You will need to log in to the Sync website using your passport details if you are:

* a foreign traveller without a Singapore-issued identification number (i.e. NRIC/FIN)
* Submitting for your child who is under the age of 15 (in which case you will need to enter your child’s passport details)

**Please note:** 
* This applies to General Category (Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)) and Category I travellers entering Singapore from 14 March 2022, 2359 hours.
* You will be able to log in to Sync with your passport details only after passing through customs in Singapore.

On the next page, you will be prompted to input your passport details – this needs to be done separately for each traveller. Please enter your:
* Nationality and passport number
* Date of birth

Then tap 'Log in' to proceed.
