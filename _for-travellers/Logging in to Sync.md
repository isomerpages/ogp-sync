### **Sync for travellers**
![](/images/Combined_travellers.png)

Welcome to Singapore! 

If you have been instructed to submit your test results after arriving in Singapore, please use the login method that applies to you:

* For foreign travellers **without a Singapore-issued identification number** (i.e. NRIC/FIN), you will need to log in to the Sync website **using your passport details**. 

[![](/images/New%20Log%20in%20button%20-%20Passport.png)](https://app.sync.gov.sg/non-singpass-login)

* For travellers **with access to Singpass**, please log in to the Sync website **using your Singpass account**.

* For travellers **without access to Singpass but with a Singapore-issued identification number (e.g. children)**, please submit your test results using the form at the following [link](https://go.gov.sg/agsubmit). This form is outside Sync, but your result will still be sent to the relevant authorities.

> **Please note:** 
> * If you are using your passport details to log in to Sync, you will be able to do so 30 minutes after passing through immigration and customs in Singapore. If you are still having trouble logging in, please submit an enquiry via the Contact Us button at [ask.gov.sg/agency/sync](https://ask.gov.sg/agency/sync).
> *For the latest travel requirements and updates, please refer to the SafeTravel website [here](safetravel.ica.gov.sg/arriving/general-travel/fully-vaccinated).
