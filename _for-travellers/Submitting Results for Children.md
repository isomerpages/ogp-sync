If you are travelling with a child who is required to take a Rapid Antigen Test, but does **not** have a Singapore-issued identification number (i.e. NRIC/FIN) you can submit the test result on their behalf using their passport details. 

1. Go to [app.sync.gov.sg](https://app.sync.gov.sg/) and tap on 'Log in with Passport Details'. If you are logged in with your own passport details, please log out before logging in again with your child's passport details.
2. Enter your child's nationality, passport number, and date of birth, then tap 'Log in'.
3. Tap on the **'Submit ART Result'** button.

Note: If your child is an incoming traveller submitting ART results for travel purposes, you **do not need to add a recipient** for their submission. Your submission will be sent automatically to the relevant authorities.

Your child's name and passport details will be automatically added to the submission form. Select whether their result was **Negative** or **Positive**, then tap **Submit**. If necessary, you may also change the date and time of submission.

In case you test positive on your ART, please visit [go.gov.sg/covid-travellers](https://go.gov.sg/covid-travellers) for more information.
