### **Keep your COVID-19 records in sync**
Sync is a government web portal initiated by the Ministry of Health and [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/), GovTech, for anyone to share and submit COVID-19 records (vaccination and test records) with organisations remotely. Using Sync is like making a financial transaction; instead of money, Sync allows individuals to choose who to share their COVID-19 health records with, and can remove their consent at any time. 

Presently, Sync shares COVID-19 ART and PCR swab tests results, and vaccination records.


#### **How is Sync useful to you?** 
* Share your verified health records (COVID-19 vaccination status, PCR and ART swab results) with any organisation you work with, or even with multiple organisations at a go.
* Submit weekly ART self-swab test results easily and securely with name, NRIC, and mobile number already filled in.
* Automatically share your ART and PCR swabs taken at other centres / clinics with organisations.


#### **What's in it for organisations?** 
* Timely access to verified vaccination status and test results of staff easily.
	* Staff provide consent to share their health records easily with organisations 
	* Daily reports containing vaccination and test records of all staff who have provided consent will be sent to authorised admin users. 
* Enables monitoring of workplace safety and booster vaccination progress
