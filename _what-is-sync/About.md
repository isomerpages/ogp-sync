### **Keep your COVID-19 records in sync**
Sync is a web platform developed by [Open Government Products](https://www.open.gov.sg/) that enables consent-based sharing of COVID-19 test results and vaccination records. Developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Sync allows individuals to instantly share their COVID-19 records with employers and other organisations and control access rights.

Presently, Sync shares COVID-19 ART and PCR swab tests results, and vaccination records.

* Automatically share your ART and PCR swabs taken at other centres / clinics with organisations.


#### **What's in it for organisations?**
