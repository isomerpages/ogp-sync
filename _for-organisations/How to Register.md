### **Registration**

Log in with Singpass to register your interest: 
[go.gov.sg/sync-company-form](https://form.gov.sg/#!/618a18ede7d4290016fd18db)

Please have the following ready: 

* Authorised representative's name, email, and mobile number
* Company name (to be displayed on Sync)
* Email addresses of authorised representatives who will receive daily reports
* Your company's logo (a clear image, in a 1:1 square ratio)

Accept Sync Terms & Conditions, and submit the form.

You will be notified once your organisation is registered on Sync. Your UEN will be your **Organisation Code** â€“ ask your staff use this code to add your organisation as a recipient. You will then automatically start receiving their health data.

#### **Corppass**

Your Singpass will need to be linked to your organisation's Corppass. Approach the Registered Officer (RO) in your organisation to do so.
