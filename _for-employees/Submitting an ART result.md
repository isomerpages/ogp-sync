Your name, NRIC / FIN & mobile number will be automatically added to the self-swab submission form. Select whether your result was **Negative** or **Positive**, then tap **Submit**. If necessary, you may also change the date and time of submission.

Youâ€™re done! You will be taken back to the Sync homepage automatically. 

Your submission will be sent to organisations you have consented to share your data with, and stored in MOH's database. **Sync does not store your health data.**
