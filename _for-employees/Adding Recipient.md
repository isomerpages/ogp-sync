You will need to provide **consent** to an organisation for them to access your records.

To do so, tap or click on the **'Add recipient'** button.

**Important:
Check to make sure you are adding the correct organisation as a recipient. Any organisations you give consent to will be able to view your records.**


### **Enter organisation code**

Ask your manager/HR team or authorised representative for your organisation's code. For companies, this is typically the company's Unique Entity Number (**UEN**).

Enter the organisation code, and tap or click **'Next'.**

If you are working with multiple organisations, please repeat this step to add and give consent to each organisation separately.
