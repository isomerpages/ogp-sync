### **What data does Sync have access to?**

Sync only pulls your health data (vaccination status, ART / PCR swab results) from the MOH database, and name and NRIC from MyInfo. With the exception of your mobile number, we do not store your data on Sync.

### **Does Sync store my health data?**

Sync does not store your health data on our system. Your health data is stored securely in the MOH database and shared with organisations directly. Likewise, ART self-submitted swab tests submitted on Sync goes directly to the MOH database and organisations without being stored on Sync. 

**Important: Remember to stop sharing your health records once you stopped working with an organisation.**

### **How does Sync protect privacy?**
Sync is a consent based system that puts the control of user's health data in their hands. Users may share and remove access to their health data with organisations as and when required.
