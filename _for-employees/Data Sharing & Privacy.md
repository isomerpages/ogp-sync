### **What data does Sync have access to?**

Sync can only access your health data (vaccination status, ART / PCR swab results) from the MOH database, and your name and NRIC from Singpass. Apart from your mobile number, none of your other data is stored on Sync.

### **Does Sync store my health data?**

Sync **does not** store your health data on our system. Your health data is stored securely in the MOH database, and shared directly with organisations you explicitly consent to. Results of ART tests you submit on Sync go directly to the MOH database and organisations that have your consent, without being stored on Sync. 

**Important: Remember to stop sharing your records once you stop working with an organisation, or once an event you're attending has ended.**

### **How does Sync protect privacy?**
Sync is a consent-based system that gives individuals full control of their personal health data. Individuals can choose who they share their health data with.
