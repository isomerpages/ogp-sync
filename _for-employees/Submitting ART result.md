You can easily submit a self-swab ART result on Sync. 

Tap on the **'Submit ART Result'** button. 

Your name, NRIC / FIN & mobile number will be automatically added to the self-swab submission form. **Select the date, time, result, and tap on the Submit button once you're done.**

Youâ€™re done! You will return back to the Sync dashboard automatically. 

The submitted data will be sent to organisations you have consented to share your data with, and the MOH database for collation.
