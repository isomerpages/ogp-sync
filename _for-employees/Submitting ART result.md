Your name, NRIC / FIN & mobile number will be automatically added to the self-swab submission form. Select the **Result**, and tap on **Submit**. If necessary, you may also change the date and time of submission.

Youâ€™re done! You will return back to the Sync dashboard automatically. 

The submitted data will be sent to organisations you have consented to share your data with, and **stored on the MOH database**. Sync does not store your health data on our system.
