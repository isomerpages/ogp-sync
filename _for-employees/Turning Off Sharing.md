### **Turning off sharing**

![](/images/Toggle%20off.svg)

To stop sharing your records with an organisation, **simply toggle off the switch** â€“ the organisations will then appear greyed out.

![](/images/Delete.svg)

To delete an organisation from your recipient list, click or tap on **'i'** beside the organisation's name, followed by **'Delete'**. The recipient will be removed from your homepage.

You can always add an organisation back using the **'Add recipient'** button. 

**Important: Remember to stop sharing your records once you stop working with an organisation, or once an event you're attending has ended.**
