### **How do I stop sharing?**

![](/images/Toggle%20off.svg)

**Simply toggle the icon off.** Organisations will appear greyed out once you stop sharing your records with them.


![](/images/Delete.svg)

To delete the organisation from your recipient list, click or tap on **'i'** beside the organisation's name, followed by **'Delete'**. This recipient will be removed from your homepage and sharing will be paused.

You can always add the organisations back by tapping on the **'Add recipient'** button. 



**Important: Remember to stop sharing your health records once you stopped working with an organisation.**
