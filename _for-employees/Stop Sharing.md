### **How do I stop sharing?**



**Simply toggle the icon off.** Organisations will appear greyed out once you stop sharing your records with them.

To delete the organisation from your recipient list, **tap on the 'i' button** beside the organisation's name and **tap on 'Delete'**. This recipient will be removed from your homepage and sharing will be paused. You can always add it back by tapping on the 'Add recipient' button. 


**Important: Remember to stop sharing your health records once you stopped working with an organisation.**
